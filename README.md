# Cranial-Cervical-anatomy

This is a little atlas drawn by me (Alex He), with the intention of helping others who may want to learn a bit about anatomy. 
- There are contributions from other Authors as well including but not limited to: 
- Sumen A (For the well drawn downloadable pdf notes)
- Frank Netter (Many of these are inspired by his drawings)

The html, javascript and css is really shoddily designed, since I don't know how to make it. However, all images are handdrawn. 

be wary, there may be mistakes, but hopefully this does help you out a bit.
