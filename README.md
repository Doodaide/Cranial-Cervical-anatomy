# Cranial-Cervical-anatomy

This is a little atlas drawn by me (Alex He), with the intention of helping others who may want to learn a bit about anatomy. 

The html, javascript and css is really shoddily designed, since I don't know how to make it. However, all images are handdrawn. 

be wary, there may be mistakes, but hopefully this does help you out a bit.
